# ECNU-Campus-Navigation
## Yehan WANG, ECNU

### Ⅰ Overview
East China Normal University is a renowned comprehensive university located in Shanghai, boasting a long history and a rich campus culture. With the continuous development and expansion of the university campuses, a campus navigation application is essential to help freshmen, visitors, and campus members better familiarize themselves with the environment. This project delivers a robust campus navigation system implemented in C++ to provide a wide array of routing, location management, and graph-theoretic algorithm functionalities.

### Ⅲ Implementation
1\. **Vertex Management**  
- Add, delete, modify, and query detailed campus location information, including site name, location type, and recommended visiting duration.
- Display comprehensive summaries of all location information currently stored in the system.
- Support data persistence by importing or exporting vertex datasets from/to external CSV files.  

2\. **Edge Management**  
- Add, delete, modify, and query routing paths connecting different campus locations.
- Display comprehensive summaries of all edge connectivity and distance matrix information.
- Support data persistence by importing or exporting edge datasets from/to external CSV files.  

3\. **Navigation & Graph Algorithms** 
- Compute the absolute shortest path between any two designated locations based on Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Analyze the graph topology to determine the existence of an Eulerian Path based on undirected graph degree conditions.
- Calculate MST across the campus graph using Kruskal's algorithm to optimize path coverage.
- Perform topologically constrained shortest path calculations based on specific routing restrictions.
- Query and display all adjacent edges and immediate neighbors of any selected location vertex.
- Filter and query campus locations dynamically based on specific category types.  

4\. **Multi-Campus Cross-Tour Route Planning**
- Plan comprehensive excursion routes specifically from the North Zhongshan Road Campus gate to the Minhang Campus gate. 
- Allow users to input a customized time budget, which must be greater than or equal to the absolute minimum path travel time between the two campus gates.
- Generate all feasible tour schemes within the user's specified time budget, dynamically calculating the total time consumption by summing both path travel times and individual spot-visiting durations.  
```
Note: The start and end points for this feature are strictly bound to the specific vertices "North Zhongshan Road Campus Gate"  and "Minhang Campus Gate". Since these dedicated vertices are absent in certain generalized or large-scale random test datasets, please use the `ring_100/` and `random_dense_100/` datasets to properly test and verify this functionality.
```

### Ⅳ Compilation
1\. **Prerequisites**
- A C++ compiler supporting the C++11 standard or higher.
- Ensure that the dataset files (`nodes.csv` and `edges.csv`) from your chosen test case are placed in the same execution directory as the compiled program.

2\. **Compilation Steps**
- Navigate to the `CampusNavigation` source code folder using your terminal.
- Execute the following standard compilation command to link the source files together:
```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp LGraph.cpp Algorithm.cpp -o CampusNavigator
```

3\. **Running the Application**
- Launch the executable from the terminal to open the interactive console menu:
```
./CampusNavigator
```
- Follow the terminal on-screen prompts to import CSV datasets, manage graph components, or run specific path-finding algorithms.
